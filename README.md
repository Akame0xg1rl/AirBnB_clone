AirBnB Clone - The Console

At the forefront of the ALXSE program AirBnB project lies the console, representing the genesis of our exploration into intricate realms of advanced programming. Our mission with the AirBnB project is to realize the deployment of a server that emulates the essence of the AirBnB website (HBnB). Embedded within this phase is the development of a command interpreter, poised to orchestrate seamless object management for the AirBnB (HBnB) platform.

Functionalities provided by this command interpreter include:

Certainly, here's a refined version:

1. Create new entities, such as users or places.
2. Retrieve existing entities from files or databases.
3. Perform various operations on these entities, such as counting or generating statistics.
4. Modify entity details as required.
5. Delete entities when necessary.
